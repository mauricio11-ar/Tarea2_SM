    "Machine learning and Python are a natural pairing, too.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is useful for implementing algorithms that can detect patterns, which is key in facial recognition software, voice recognition and recommendation systems like those Amazon and YouTube rely on. It’s an unbelievably hot area.\n",
    "\n",
    ">I think the machine learning is the key to the future, and this tool can be applied, to any situation,in my area, how a civil engineer has many opportunities, for example, use this system to find solutions and make decisions.\n",
